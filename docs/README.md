# SmartKoozie

# Features:
Koozie that actively cools your drink  
Keeps track of how many drinks you’ve had that session  
Controlled through physical IO buttons and screen and/or app  
Battery powered  
# Components:
Sensing: Temperature sensor, switch or pressure sensor to count how many drinks you’ve had, some way to monitor power draw  
Wireless communication: Probably a bluetooth module  
PCB: Used to connect everything together. Shouldn’t be computationally expensive, but size is a major concern, as is power draw  
Other: Cooler, heatsinks, insulating material, fan(?), battery, some way of charging-USB C would be nice and could also be used for updating firmware, other small components  
The cooler is a 4cmx4cm pad that utilizes the Peltier effect to remove heat using electricity - no refrigerant required.
